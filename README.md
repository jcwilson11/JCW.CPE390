# ***This course is complete***

## This repo will contain all related files and notes to CPE 390, an undergraduate course at Stevens Institute of Technology

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course covers how computers work (computer architecture) through assembly language
and learning how to program them at a low level.
It also uses microcontrollers to interact with their external environment (embedded systems).

We have a wide variety of software and hardware labs. While there are more than can be done in any semester these include

1. Programming together in git (using version control)
1. Bit manipulation
1. Implementing drawing primitives in a bitmap
1. Optimizing floating point computation in a gravity simulator
1. Controlling motors using MOSFETs, H-Bridge controllers and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
1. Generating waveforms using a DAC and measuring them
1. Building a photogate using photoresistors and A/D converter
